# Bingo-tracker
Play Bingo in MatLab (kind of).

## play_bingo.m
This file will play the designated number of games with the give number of cards. It will tally the winners into stats.heatmap.
It will also track the number of horizontal, vertical, and diagnoal wins. It also tracks which round the winner won on.

## bingo_gui
This simple gui will play games until it is interupted. It basically has play_bingo built into it.
You can change the number of cards on the fly. Also allows pausing. Currently no way to reset the counters without restarting.

## for_playing
Draws bingo "balls" much like you would in real life and displays them. Add a breakpoint to allow following along.
